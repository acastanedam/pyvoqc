# Test Cases

This directory has a couple test scripts for debugging. `basic_test.py` simply runs all the functions available in pyvoqc to check for seg faults in the C code. `test_qiskit_pass.py` checks functional correctness of a couple methods using pyvoqc's Qiskit interface.

When you run these scripts, you should not see any errors or exceptions -- please file an issue if these scripts fail on your machine.
